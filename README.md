# interest_calculator

This is a script that you can use to check what changes in 
your loan payment plan when you decide to pay a bit extra every month. 
The script needs the start loan, start month and year, APR, required payment amount per 
month and extra payment amount per month.

Run the script without any arguments and it will display a help message.
